This template contains a collection of measures to assess the perception of hackathon participants after an event has ended. The measures included in this template cover **individual aspects** such as a participant's motivation to participate, prior hackathon experience,  programming experience, and demographics. They also cover **team aspects** such as a participant's perception of the team composition, the team process, and the team’s project. In addition, the template contains measures related to a participant's perception of the **community** that organized the event and the **hackathon** itself.

The measures included in the template are based on previously validated scales. The respective sources are referenced next to each scale. The scales included here have been utilized as part of the data collection for various studies of hackathons that have been published in various venues in the domains of software engineering [1, 3, 8, 9], human-computer interaction [2, 5, 6], and beyond [4, 7, 10].

We do not suggest using all measures contained in this template for each event. In fact, measures are often only suitable for hackathons that focus on specific goals (e.g., programming experience might only be relevant for a programming-related event). Moreover, there are also measures that assess very similar aspects of an event but in a slightly different way (e.g., the participant’s overall satisfaction with an event and their intentions to participate in a similar event again in the future). We thus encourage whoever uses this template to create a survey that fits their specific needs. This includes adding scales that might be important for a specific event and removing scales that are not perceived to be relevant. However, when adapting the survey, please make sure to keep the scales intact. Altering them might compromise their integrity. In addition, __we suggest including items that are marked with a hash (#) in every hackathon survey__. We found these helpful for most, if not all, hackathon events.

If you utilize this instrument to study an event, we would appreciate it if you would be willing to share anonymized responses with us. Please contact the main author for further details. A downloadable and citable version of this planning kit is available on Zenodo:

## Survey Cover Page

As an attendee of the [HACKATHON_NAME] hackathon, you are invited to complete the following survey. This hackathon is organized by [HACKATHON_ORGANIZERS]. The main purpose of this survey is [SURVEY_PURPOSE].

The questions are mostly multiple choice / agree-disagree and will take approximately [COMPLETION_TIME_IN_MINUTES] minutes to answer. The risks that are associated with this survey are no greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life. Your decision regarding whether or not to participate in this study will not result in any loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. Your participation in this survey is voluntary, and you may discontinue participation at any time. Your responses will be de-identified and will remain confidential to the study team.

Anonymized responses to this survey might also be shared with a group of researchers at Eindhoven University of Technology.

If you have any further questions about the survey, please contact [ROLE] [HACKATHON_ORGANIZER_NAME] (HACKATHON_ORGANIZER_EMAIL).
<br/>
I am age 18 or older, I have read and understood the above information, and I wish to participate in the research and continue with the survey.
- [ ] Yes (continue the survey)
- [ ] No (end the survey)

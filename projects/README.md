# Projects directory

This directory contains markdown files which describe each of the projects executed during the event.

There is a GitHub action which will generate these markdown files from project proposals in the GitHub issues. 

To make the Action work, assign the label `accepted-project` to the appropriate project proposal.

Watch GitHub do its magic.
